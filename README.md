# React-Web-Application
## This is a simple react web application with the use of react-router and material UI.


## Why did I choose React?
I have been using pug.js for a long time, so I needed a powerful front end library to provide a design based mechanism like component or an import block feature, which I found in react.js.

## Set any component according to your choice
You can add any number of components or change their information so that they look like other components, but the is actually an element that looks different.

## React test site.
React is a exploring library that provides lots of features in less amount of code so the one of the easiest way to create interactive front end in very effective way.

Thank you.
